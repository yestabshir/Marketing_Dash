Compare DW and LT data to understand the difference between structured and unstructured data. We will primarily be working with Data Warehouse data.
Update Data Warehouse data using sql script.

Business Request & User Stories
Read the sample business request, demand overview & filled-out user stories to understand the problem we are trying to solve with Data Analysis and what we consider as a solution.

Clean the Data using T-SQL
Understand the difference between FACT tables & Dimension tables.
Identify which tables in the data are of interest with the help of the Business Request form.
Choose which columns are of interest to export by preparing and transforming these columns in SQL using concepts such as: renaming columns, combining columns, commenting in SQL script, formatting of SQL statements, WHERE clause, ORDER BY, LEFT JOIN, CASE() function and ISNULL() function.
